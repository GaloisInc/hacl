This script 'ecdsa.saw' in this directory performs a proof of
equivalence between the Java ECDSA implementation contained in
'ecdsa.jar' and the Cryptol-generated SBV files located in the 'sbv'
subdirectory.

To run it, edit run.sh to point to the correct location of 'classes.jar'
or 'rt.jar', from JDK 6, on your machine. Then do:

    ./run.sh
